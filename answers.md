# Activity 4  
## Notes  

* 1D arrays can store data through Row-major order (all data for the each row comes first) or Column-major order  
* Rows and columns in Java are indexed (starting at 0 for each column and row)  
* Java uses arrays of arrays to store data, which can be column-major or row-major  
* For-each loop can be used to avoid indices (for (int item : array)) > goes through each integer and stores it in 'item'
